## Direct Memory Access (DMA) and Interrupt Handling

In this series on hardware basics, we have already looked at read and write bus cycles. In this article we will cover Direct Memory Access (DMA) and Interrupt Handling. Knowledge of DMA and interrupt handling would be useful in writing code that interfaces directly with IO devices (DMA based serial port design pattern is a good example of such a device).

We will discuss the following topics:
